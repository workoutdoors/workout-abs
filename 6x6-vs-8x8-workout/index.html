<p>And the 8x8 has more sets per body part but the weight isn�t nearly as high. The related 6x6 workout routine is an intermediate version of the same program. If so, are the exercises alternating in a superset fashion? So, today i bumped up the action to 8x8, with 15 second rests.</p>

<p>I trained under vince in 1981 at his gym (makawway was there at that time and jeff goldblum “the fly” also). It will no doubt put on slabs and slabs of muscle in very short time periods.

<p>6×6 and 8×8 vince gironda training. If you can�t do all 6 sets with a strict 30 second break, reduce the weight until you can use shorter rest periods. The following program is an 8x8 style workout and it follows an upper/lower split. This workout has been known to bring trainees to their knees—even when they�re using pygmy weights—because of.</p>

<p>Hey guys, just looking for opinions here, between 4x8 (4 sets of 8 reps) vs 8x8 (8 sets and 8 reps).which one is considered more beneficial. Something to do with the stress this type of training puts on the muscle. The related 6x6 workout routine is an intermediate version of the same program. It would make more sense to stick.</p>

<p>Remember, the key factor with this loading scheme is density, not load. This workout was 56 sets and took about 40 minutes. Perform six rounds of six exercises (36 total bouts) taken to volitional muscular fatigue at approximately 10 repetitions. 6x6, 8x8, 10x10 — multiple cycles. Would it be best to do three ful body 6x6 workouts.</p>

<p>I have three days a week to train with weights. Upper body high pulley rows to the upper back incline bench presses It will no doubt put on slabs and slabs of muscle in very short time periods. The 8×8 method of training involves picking one exercise per bodypart, and by using the same weight for every set completing 8.</p>

<p>It is a high volume, old school bodybuilding programs that have become the stuff of legend. So, today i bumped up the action to 8x8, with 15 second rests. It will no doubt put on slabs and slabs of muscle in very short time periods. It would be perfect for someone looking to add lean muscle mass. Perform six rounds.</p>
