<p>16% of my free time just getting to the gym. Why aren’t more gyms open 24/7. The reason gyms can charge so little is that most members don�t go. Gym employees are there in the late mornings and afternoons; It seems like gyms may be opening next weekend but i’m confused as to why they don’t make masks mandatory at.</p>

<p>16% of my free time just getting to the gym. It seems like gyms may be opening next weekend but i’m confused as to why they don’t make masks mandatory at all times? Why aren’t more gyms open 24/7. If i�m not mistaken, being in restaurants is legal. You can do that in your own house.</p>

<p>“that’s why we’re offering membership freezes free of charge. 16% of my free time just getting to the gym. Thinking of it from a business perspective, i was always baffled by the missed opportunities that gyms had if they only offered some sort of 1 day pass. Students may lack the drive and motivation to go to the gym themselves.</p>

<p>Why aren’t more gyms open 24/7. That meant 40 minutes of driving every time i wanted to do a workout: Why aren’t there saunas at otf gyms. Followed a strict macronutrient plan, and you still aren’t. Because the gym, for most, is simply not working.</p>

<p>Originally posted by the game. “that’s why we’re offering membership freezes free of charge. Gym owners.ever notice that most big businesses offer financing?.why arent gyms? You can do that in your own house. When you post that phrase all over your gym, scream it in your ads, and label it on all of your merchandise, all anyone can think about.</p>

<p>More often than not, when looking at food diaries i am shocked by the little amount of “real” food i see. If i�m not mistaken, being in restaurants is legal. Why aren�t gyms being opened up? Posted by 1 year ago. Thinking of it logically, most people go to another state or cou.</p>
