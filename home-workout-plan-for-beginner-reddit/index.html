<p>Beginner home workout plan made by the bodyweight fitness reddit community. I really wanna work on getting fit and building up some arm and core strength since im in marching band and play a 60 pound instrument. This allows for high workout frequency and a full body split workout while still allowing each muscle group adequate recovery time. 2 minutes rest between sets.</p>
<h3 id="add-some-rest-between-the-exercises-if-needed">Add some rest between the exercises if needed.</h3><p>3 exercises that will be performed in a triplet to enhance your core strength. 3 sets of 10 (3x10) for each workout, 3 days a week (m, w, f) week 3: Post your workout routines here. Here�s a sample i did to address my weaknesses: It is essentially a full body strength program 4 times a day. This is just a beginners workout to get people moving.</p>
