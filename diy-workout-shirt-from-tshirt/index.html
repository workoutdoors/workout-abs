<p>And so since the year has almost come to an end, i decided to give my executive board members an extra shirt to mess around with. A very popular diy indeed and one that people came back for over and over again! The stretchy knit material would accommodate your width. June 14, 2016 by katie adams 12 comments.</p>
<h3 id="fold-the-shirt-in-half">Fold the shirt in half.</h3><p>I personally like racer backs a lot more than regular straight tank tops. Modify the armhole to make a muscle tank. An oldie, but a goodie! I also use a cricut cutting machine to do the cutting. Then, make sure you put marks on the front so that the end points are even. It was really helpful, because something about new workout clothes helps motivate me(i don’t know why).</p>
