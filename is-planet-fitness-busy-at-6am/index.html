<p>Late at night (past 8 pm if your gym is still open) I decided to join planet fitness for several reasons: Yesterday at 8:00 am Â·. 1) itï¿½s the closest gym to my house. Work out in the morning.</p>

<p>What time is planet fitness the least busy? I take issue with the idea of driving to go work out, so i like that i can walk here. I have since moved and so i have tried this location twice. Whatâ€™s the least busy time at planet fitness? Usually very low numbers of people.</p>

<p>However, that depends on the specific gym because they open at slightly different times. Busy if you want cardio. Thinking planet fitness might be better? Usually very low numbers of people. There are lulls during the work day but they get very busy on lunch or after a typical work day schedule :) 4 reply</p>
