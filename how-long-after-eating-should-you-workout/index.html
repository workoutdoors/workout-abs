<p>After a normal to large meal: It’s generally suggested that people should wait to exercise three to four hours after eating a substantial meal, according to mayo clinic. Those who exercise for over 90 minutes, should eat. Depending on the kind of exercise you are about to do, depends on how long you can get away with waiting.</p>
<h3 id="after-a-normal-to-large-meal">After a normal to large meal:</h3><p>Generally speaking, give yourself anywhere from one to three hours to participate in weight training after eating. Waiting longer than those two hours can lead to a longer recovery. Where the exercise is not high intensity such as a light walk, waiting a while to exercise after eating is not so crucial. Those who exercise for over 90 minutes, should eat or drink more carbohydrates (such as a sports bar, trail mix with nuts, yogurt and granola),. The intensity of your workout will also affect the period of time in which you should wait. Proper fueling at this time will help you feel satiated during your workout, keep the stomach cramps at bay (if you choose the right food!) and give you energy for your workout.</p>
