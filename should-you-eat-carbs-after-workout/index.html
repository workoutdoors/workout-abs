<h3 id="if-you-eat-your-carbohydrates-after-a-workout-youre-less-likely-to-cheat-on-carbohydrates-later-on">If you eat your carbohydrates after a workout, you’re less likely to “cheat” on carbohydrates later on.</h3><p>The benefit of eating carbs right after exercise is that your body craves them and will most readily use them for replenishment instead of storage.
