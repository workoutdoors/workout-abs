<p>Good buzz and energy from it but flavour is absolutely disgusting, even for a pre workout, little green bits floating around in it after mixing, horrible aftertaste.

<p>I know it’s kicking in about a half hour when i feel my lips tingling and i feel a bit restless and ready to go! It was very sweet and also pretty fruity, and the aftertaste was. Tatse it really nice and is so convenient first thing in a morning to take to bed and have as soon as i.</p>

<p>I have been using myprotein pre workout for a couple years now and really like the watermelon and blue raspberry flavors. The myprotein mypre pre workout formula grade is 7.8.
