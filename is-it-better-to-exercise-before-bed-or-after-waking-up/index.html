<p>In your specific case i�d say aim to do it when you get up because it�s closer to the time you normally train and will help with consistency, then if you don�t manage to do it. If you�re trying to lose weight or burn fat, consider working out first thing in the morning. Why i say this is because all night shift workers, well all humans actually, need to exercise vigorously (the huff and puff kind of stuff) daily for a recommended 150 minutes per week. This is because fluid gathers in the spine as we sleep and it can take approx 1 hour to dissepate.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-thought-of-waking-up-before-the-sun-rises-to-exercise-before-work-stresses-you-out-dont-force-it">If the thought of waking up before the sun rises to exercise before work stresses you out, don’t force it.</h3><p>Is it better to do exercise or study immediately after waking up for a student to maintain energy through out the day? Very light exercise like jogging for a few 100 meters, yoga, stretches, very few different types of push ups and pull ups. Whatever you�re doing, take 15, 20, or even 30 minutes to get going, have a bottle of water, stretch out, and move around, says dr. Resistance exercise or light aerobic exercise performed in the early evening are best for reducing nighttime awakenings, possibly because they impart the benefits of exercise without excessively raising body temperature. Your body warms up as you exercise, then cools down an hour or two after you stop. Yes, you should stretch after waking up.</p>
