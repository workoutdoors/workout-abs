<p>As a beginner, the weight used for each exercise doesn’t create as much stress as it would when using heavier weights at a more advanced level. Add 2.5 lbs to the upper body lifts (bench, overhead press, row, chinup) each day you do the lift. In all the above cases i am assuming that the diet and training are on.</p>

<p>Keeping your back flat, lift the weight up until your left elbow is above your body. Just use easier variations of the same movements. You need to start light and work your way up. I have no idea how to get started. If not your body gets used to the progressive overload of a muscle being challenged a certain way.</p>
